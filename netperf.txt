Netperf Installation - Performance measurement

# wget ftp://ftp.netperf.org/netperf/netperf-2.7.0.tar.bz2
# tar xvf netperf-2.7.0.tar.bz2
# cd netperf-2.7.0
# ./configure
# make
# su
# make install

In the standard configuration, netserver would run under inetd; however, inetd is obsolete.  Many distros don't even include it by default.  Besides, you probably don't want to leave the benchmark server running all the time.

Instead of configuring inetd, therefore, run netserver in standalone mode:

# /usr/local/bin/netserver

Testing

# netperf

from another server 

# netperf -H <ip-address>,ipv4

# netperf -H <ip-address>
